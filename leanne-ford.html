This made her 39 years of age in 2020. Corresponding to her birthday, Leanne has zodiac cancer.</p><h2><span id=WikipediaFamily_Related_to_Diane_Keaton>Wikipedia—Family, Related to Diane Keaton?</span></h2><p>Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Leanne Ford is from a family of five. She’s got a sister named Michelle Ford Faist who was wired in StarKist’s headquarters, and you may already know her brother/co-star of Ford Restoration, Steve Ford. As for her parents, Mike and Jackie Ford were born to Leanne. Her dad, Mike, attended Villanova University and practiced as a lawyer in his private practice for over 35 years. Wheres, the mother of Leanne remained a mystery to us. All we know is that the parents have been happily married for over 35 years.</p><p>If Leanne Ford was linked to actress Diane Keaton, come to the matter. The response to this is “No.” While they have a striking similarity to the fact that even the L.A. Times called them “uncanny,” and the New York Times named them similar, they were in no way linked to blood. However, Leanne said she was “honored” and had even spoken to Diane personally about it. She posted it,</p><p>“I met her at a party here in LA, and she said, ‘Oh, you’re so cute!’ And I said, ‘That’s because I look like you!'”</p><h2><span id=Leanne_Ford8217s_Height_weight_distinguishing_features>Leanne Ford’s Height, weight, distinguishing features</span></h2><p>Leanne Ford is 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) tall and weighs around 55kg (121 lbs). Her body measurements were said to be 35-28-35 inches. Mentioning her distinct features, Leanne’s eyes were green and she loved to wear her hair short.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Reaches_Instagram_Facebook_Twitter>Social Media Reaches: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter</span></h2><p>As of Dec 2020, Leanne boasted 350K followers over her Instagram, which she packed with esthetic decorations and interior designs. Also, her Facebook page “Leanne Ford Interiors” had 8.8K followers while her private Facebook account had “followed” shut down. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find a Twitter account for her.</p><h2><span id=Leanne_Ford_Net_Worth_HGTV_Career_etc>Leanne Ford Net Worth, HGTV, Career, etc.</span></h2><p>Leanne Ford’s net worth in 2020 was $2 million. Graduated from Ohio University, Leanne began her career as an intern for the fashion brand Heatherette, and finally got a job at Roxy as a stylist. And while she never had formal education in interior design, it wasn’t going to discourage her! Soon, her work and, in particular, her “look” caught the attention of a few HGTV producers. Then she was asked to give them a demo video of the renovation she was working on with Steve. At first, the producers saw her as “too cool,” but without the “glasses and hat,” Leanne was considered ideal for the show. Trivia: HGTV asked for more color in her designs, but she remained true to her element, the palette of white, black, and white.</p><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto" data-tablestyle=MsoTableGrid data-tablelook=1696><tbody><tr><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Estimated Net Worth in 2021</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td><td data-celllook=0><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>$2 million.&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Previous Year’s Net Worth (2020)</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td><td data-celllook=0><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>$1.5 million.&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Annual Salary</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Under Review.</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Income Source</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td><td data-celllook=0><p>&nbsp;interior designer</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Leanne expressed that she had “never set out to be an interior designer.” Though she was in design, working on creative direction and styling, she never felt she would decorate a home. Her first job was at the old one-room schoolhouse in Pittsburgh in 2010. She shared that she “took the walls, gutted the kitchen and the bathroom, really did what I wanted!” And that house was featured in the Country Living Magazine after receiving some public attention. So, for the first time, she realized her call.</p><h2><span id=Leanne_Ford_Husband_Married_Life>Leanne Ford Husband, Married Life,</span></h2><p>The lucky man who’d share Leanne Ford’s “European Dream” home is her husband, Erik Allen Ford. If you don’t know much about him, Erik is an entrepreneur and co-founder of the men’s apparel company, Buck Mason. Leanne and Erik first met back in 2015 during a bonfire in the backyard. Falling for Leanne at first sight, Erik took six months to eventually get Leanne to say “yes” to her first date. And after almost two years of dating, the couple got married in November 2017 at The Bowery Hotel, NY. They reportedly had a “spontaneous” wedding. Leanne said they got married only after four days of making up their minds. Also, Leanne expressed that there were “two things” that they decided on when they first met: firstly, they wouldn’t get married, and secondly, they wouldn’t have children. Then she laughed, “And here we are now.”</p><p>Breaking the “contract” one after the other, the lovebirds welcomed a baby girl named Ever Allen Ford on March 18, 2019. According to Leanne, they were hoping for a boy if they ever had a son, but after the birth of their daughter, they realized, “Actually, that feels really right.” Besides, Leanne clarified why she chose the name “Ever” for her child. In her own terms,” Her name, Ever, means ‘everlasting and eternal.’ We believe that this sweet soul has been put on this planet for a reason, and we can’t wait to see what it will be.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>interior designer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Wren Eleanor</a></h3>Wren Eleanor is a well-known TikTok celebrity, YouTuber, media personality, social media star, and online personality from the United States of America (born May 21, 2019; age: 3 years).
