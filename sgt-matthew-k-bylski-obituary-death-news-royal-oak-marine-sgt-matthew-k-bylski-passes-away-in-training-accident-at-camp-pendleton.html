<time>03 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Sgt. Matthew K. Bylski Obituary-Death News; Royal Oak Marine, Sgt. Matthew K. Bylski Passes Away In Training Accident At Camp Pendleton</strong></p><p>On Thursday, officials from the Marine Corps revealed that the Marine who was killed in a training exercise at a facility in California earlier this week was a native of Michigan. The incident occurred when the amphibious assault vehicle he was riding in rolled over for unknown reasons.</p><p>As a result of the tragedy, fourteen additional people were sent to local hospitals. Officials said on Thursday that all but one of the patients remained hospitalized and were listed as being in good condition. Certain information regarding the injuries was not made public by them.</p><p>According to a statement released by the Marine Corps, Sgt. Matthew K. Bylski, who was from Royal Oak, Michigan, passed away as a result of the injuries he got when the tactical vehicle fell over while he was participating in a ground exercise at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton on Tuesday the evening.</p><p>“Words fail to express our sorrow at the tragic loss of Sgt. Bylski; an outstanding Marine and a leader within his platoon,” said Col. Sean Dynan, commanding officer of his unit, adding that “the Marines who lived, trained, and learned from Sgt. Bylski, mourn alongside his family and friends.”</p><p>Bylski, who is 23 years old, received his training to become an Amphibious Combat Vehicle crewman during his time with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit’s Battalion Landing Team 1/5. In his capacity as a vehicle commander, he was serving.</p><p>Beginning in January 2019, he became a member of the Marine Corps and was subsequently honored with a number of medals, including the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, and other awards.</p><p>As stated in a statement that was distributed by Hazel Park Schools, Ken Bylski, Bylski’s father, described his son as “a real special kid.”</p><p>Josh Bylski, Bylski’s brother, noted that his brother was always prepared to assist anyone who needed it. “He had such a caring nature. His disposition was always positive, and he would do all in his power to help you get out of a difficult circumstance and put you in a more positive frame of mind.</p><p>The cause of the rollover is currently being investigated by the authorities.</p><p>After an amphibious assault vehicle from the Vietnam War sank off the coast of Southern California in the year 2020, resulting in the deaths of eight Marines and one sailor, the Marines were operating inside an amphibious combat vehicle, which was a model that was produced to replace the amphibious assault vehicles. It was one of the most fatal training incidents that the Marine Corps has ever experienced of its kind.</p><p>According to the findings of an investigation conducted by the Marine Corps, the sinking was caused by a lack of proper training, poor maintenance, and poor judgment on the part of the leaders.</p><p>As part of its investigation into the reasons behind why one of the amphibious combat vehicles rolled onto its side in large waves and the other one got crippled, the United States Marine Corps kept the new amphibious combat vehicles, which are a type of seafaring tank, out of the water for a period of three months in the previous year. During that incident, nobody sustained any injuries.</p><p>Amphibious vehicles are utilized by the Marine Corps in order to effectively carry troops and their equipment from Navy ships to land. As the armored vehicles that are equipped with machine guns and grenade launchers roll ashore for beach attacks, they have the appearance of tanks. Marines are running out of them to take up positions.</p><p>In accordance with the statements made by district officials, Bylski was a student athlete at Hazel Park High School in Hazel Park. He participated in both football and baseball.</p><p>Words fall short of expressing our grief for your loss, as we mourn with family and friends for this great loss. We are truly sorry to hear of the loss of this promising being. Please accept our condolences, and may our prayers help comfort you. Please accept our heartfelt condolences.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismKm%2ForrQrqacrJ%2BWu62twp2sqKaXY7KlwY2vpWirl6l6rq3TrZ%2Ber12geqPFy6yiomWfl7a1wcCrsGaclZbBqXnNnq6sZaKkxqK4jKiYpGWdlr%2BqusRmqqCsXaKutcDHnq5mo12Xxq2%2FyqJkqZmjqLK0ecCwmLJlmaN6tb7AoqWippdirqSvyJ2cp6xdlsFur8Cmp2aolaOxrbHTqKVo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsgt-matthew-k-bylski-obituary-death-news-royal-oak-marine-sgt-matthew-k-bylski-passes-away-in-training-accident-at-camp-pendleton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsgt-matthew-k-bylski-obituary-death-news-royal-oak-marine-sgt-matthew-k-bylski-passes-away-in-training-accident-at-camp-pendleton.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsgt-matthew-k-bylski-obituary-death-news-royal-oak-marine-sgt-matthew-k-bylski-passes-away-in-training-accident-at-camp-pendleton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsgt-matthew-k-bylski-obituary-death-news-royal-oak-marine-sgt-matthew-k-bylski-passes-away-in-training-accident-at-camp-pendleton.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsgt-matthew-k-bylski-obituary-death-news-royal-oak-marine-sgt-matthew-k-bylski-passes-away-in-training-accident-at-camp-pendleton.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsgt-matthew-k-bylski-obituary-death-news-royal-oak-marine-sgt-matthew-k-bylski-passes-away-in-training-accident-at-camp-pendleton.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./six-easy-lunch-kabobs-for-back-to-school.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./six-easy-lunch-kabobs-for-back-to-school.html>Six Easy Lunch Kabobs for Back to School</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./noah-schnacky-net-worth-174248.html>Noah Schnacky Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./noah-schnacky-net-worth-174248.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
