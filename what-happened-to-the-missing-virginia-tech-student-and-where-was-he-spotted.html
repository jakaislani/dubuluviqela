According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC News</a>, on Feb 16, 2024, Roop told his friends he would drive home to Abingdon, Virginia, about 100 miles from Blacksburg, where VA Tech is located. While there, he said he would finish a test online at 5 p.m. that day. He left at 10 a.m., but at around 4:30 p.m., Roop’s phone pinged at a mall just a few miles away from his apartment complex. Roop never arrived at his parents’ home, and his friends said his behavior was out of character before he left.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a>, Roop’s mom, Veronica Widener, said her son’s phone died shortly after he vanished, and unconfirmed reports say Roop was seen in surveillance footage <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">withdrawing cash at the mall</a>.

Roop was reluctant to speak with the police, she said, gave no comment on the fact he was reported missing and was otherwise acting strangely when authorities contacted him.</p><p data-characters=29 data-current-count=29 data-injectable=false>McFarlane’s post said,</p><p>“I do personally know Johnny, and I know that something is wrong with his mental state … this is still extremely strange and we are still heartbroken and terrified for his safety.”</p>via Aleah McFarlane/Facebook<p data-characters=86 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Here’s hoping Roop’s okay, and that his family get the answers they seek.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1osCMoZipqJWjsqV506hkraCVYrqqv9KipaBlpp6%2FqLXNophmrJWYtW6%2F066bnqakYq6vsIywn56qlWLEor%2BMoZxmq6CkwbWxw2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-missing-virginia-tech-student-and-where-was-he-spotted.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-missing-virginia-tech-student-and-where-was-he-spotted.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-missing-virginia-tech-student-and-where-was-he-spotted.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-missing-virginia-tech-student-and-where-was-he-spotted.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-missing-virginia-tech-student-and-where-was-he-spotted.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-missing-virginia-tech-student-and-where-was-he-spotted.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wil-myers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wil-myers.html>Wil Myers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./trinity-rodman-parents-and-family-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-soccer-player.html>Trinity Rodman Parents And Family, here Is What You Need To know About Soccer Player</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./trinity-rodman-parents-and-family-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-soccer-player.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
