He'd already appeared in hit '90s shows <i>Party of Five</i>, <i>Full House</i>, <i>Sabrina The Teenage Witch</i> and <i>7th Heaven</i> and had a face that decorated many, many bedroom walls, reports <a href=#>news.com.au</a>.</p><p><i>10 Things</i>, released in early 1999, was responsible for catapulting its young lead actors, including the late Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, into big-screen stardom — and Keegan seemed destined to go the same way.</p><p>But for some reason, his movie career never really took off.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>After <i>10 Things</i>, Keegan continued his Shakespearean teen-flick adaptation trend (<i>10 Things</i> was inspired by <i>Taming With The Shrew</i>) with high school thriller <i>O</i>, based loosely on <i>Othello</i>.</p><p>It was only a lukewarm success, and attracted mixed reviews from critics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/4mbQVY8OZM_mULZmgkAHWHz5MeA=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/RZIUEY7VMMGKIXDN5J3J6A6YFY.jpg"><p>Keegan's next movie, <i>The Broken Hearts Club</i>, was much the same story.</p><p>By the mid-noughties, the once in-demand young actor's working life was almost entirely made up of guest roles on TV shows including <i>House</i>, <i>CSI: NY</i>, and <i>7th Heaven</i>, and a handful of appearances in low-budget and direct-to-video movies.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><h2 class=article__heading>HIGH-PROFILE ROMANCES</h2><p>During the late '90s and early '00s, as his career was really blossoming, Keegan cemented his place in teen magazines everywhere with a string of high-profile girlfriends.</p><p>He briefly dated <i>Party of Five</i> co-star Jennifer Love Hewitt in 1997 before embarking on a relationship with LeAnn Rimes.</p><p>They made the perfect young celebrity couple — he was an in-demand actor, she was America's sweetheart singer.</p><p>But after three years, the romance soured and they called it quits in 2001 — reportedly around the time Keegan began taking an interest in Rimes' <i>Coyote Ugly</i> co-star Piper Perabo.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/IoDVGEu2HDazoy0NtxyPa3H0j0c=/16x25/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/SAWWJND5J4PJTI7RAME3A6CNFY.jpg"><p>In 2002, the actor met <i>The Girl Next Door</i>'s Elisha Cuthbert, and the pair started dating but they broke up a year later.</p><p>Keegan, 40, has been in a relationship with Arista Ilona for six years. They welcomed their first child together, daughter Aiya Rose, in 2016.</p><h2 class=article__heading>RELIGIOUS CALLING</h2><p>The actor, searching for an identity away from his childhood fame, claims his spiritual awakening first began after a traumatic experience. In 2011, he and a couple of friends were attacked by a gang of six men in Venice Beach, at least one of whom had a gun.</p><p>Keegan wound up in hospital and took the shocking experience as a sign, pointing him toward a higher purpose of bettering his community.</p><p>Keegan's spiritual transformation began to take a physical form in front of the 110-year-old Rose Temple in Venice, California, in 2013.</p><p>According to <i>Vulture</i>, the former child star felt "especially aligned with (the) place of worship", so he dug a hole in front of the building, and in the hole, placed "a small rose-quartz crystal" and made a promise.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/HBzMjJ6U-ap97lbnrNh2R4nMsL8=/16x25/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/2D2D5C2WY5UOW5V4ZZTSFTHABU.jpg"><p>"I was clear that if there was ever an appropriate time to be in the service of the temple, I would be," he said.</p><p>Keegan claimed that following that day, he experienced a string of bizarre coincidences which prompted him to realise his "true calling".</p><p>"I had a moment where I was looking at a street lamp and it exploded. That was a weird coincidence," he later told <i>Vice</i>.</p><p>"At a ceremony, a heart-shaped rose quartz crystal was on the altar, and synchronistically, this whole thing happened. It's a long story, but basically the crystal jumped off the altar and skipped on camera. That was weird."</p><p>In May 2014, Keegan leased the building he'd felt so connected to and launched his own new age temple called Full Circle, into which he claimed he sank $150,000 — or "everything" he had.</p><p>According to Keegan, the idea behind Full Circle was for "enlightened" members to gather at the temple to initiate change through events like concerts, political gatherings for self-help gurus, sit-ins and workshops.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The organisation briefly closed down in early 2017 as funding dried-up, before being granted a last-minute reprieve when an investor came on-board.</p><p>Unfortunately for Keegan, it was only a stay of execution, and just a few months later, Full Circle vacated the Rose Temple for good.</p><h2 class=article__heading>HOLLYWOOD DARLINGS</h2><p>In the past couple of years, Keegan's appeared in a couple of short films, and — most notably — the surprise comedy hit, <i>Hollywood Darlings</i> (currently streaming on Netflix).</p><p>The faux-reality series stars former '80s and '90s child stars Beverley Mitchell (<i>7th Heaven</i>), Christine Lakin (<i>Step By Step</i>) and Jodie Sweetin (<i>Full House</i>), who play exaggerated versions of themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/NodfuMh5pHm6zC-BnH2sh6Jkf3o=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/3XYQM54HVHVSXCX6VBABNCU5FM.jpg"><p>Given his former teen heart-throb status and recent spiritual turn, Keegan was an easy choice to guest star.</p><p>"It was fun to take the opportunity to play to what some people think I do now, so why not have fun with it," Keegan said at the show's premiere.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"This was the perfect venue to explore that creatively.
