After developing an interest in acting during high school, he rocketed to fame with his star turns in Risky Business and Top Gun. Cruise later earned acclaim for his work in the hit film Jerry Maguire and the Mission: Impossible franchise.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thomas Cruise Mapother IV, better known as Tom Cruise, was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, to Mary and Thomas Mapother. Cruise's mother was an amateur actress and schoolteacher, and his father was an electrical engineer. His family moved around a great deal when Cruise was a child to accommodate his father's career.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cruise's parents divorced when he was 11, and the children moved with their mother to Louisville, Kentucky, and then to Glen Ridge, New Jersey, after she remarried. Like his mother and three sisters, Cruise suffered from dyslexia, which made academic success difficult for him. He excelled in athletics, however, and considered pursuing a career in professional wrestling until a knee injury sidelined him during high school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At age 14, Cruise enrolled in a Franciscan seminary with thoughts of becoming a priest, but he left after a year. When he was 16, a teacher encouraged him to participate in the school's production of the musical Guys and Dolls. After Cruise won the lead of Nathan Detroit, he found himself surprisingly at home on the stage, and a career was born.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Movies</h2><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Taps,' 'The Outsiders'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cruise set a 10-year deadline for himself in which to build an acting career. He left school and moved to New York City, struggling through audition after audition before landing an appearance in 1981's Endless Love, starring Brooke Shields. Around this same time, he snagged a small role in the military school drama Taps (1981), co-starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/sean-penn data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sean Penn" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sean Penn</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His role in Taps was upgraded after director Harold Becker saw Cruise's potential, and his performance caught the attention of a number of critics and filmmakers. In 1983, Cruise appeared in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/francis-ford-coppola data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Francis Ford Coppola" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Francis Ford Coppola</a>'s The Outsiders, which also starred <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/emilio-estevez data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emilio Estevez" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Emilio Estevez</a>, Matt Dillon and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/rob-lowe data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rob Lowe" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rob Lowe</a>—all prominent members of a group of young actors the entertainment press dubbed the "Brat Pack." The film was not well received, but it allowed Cruise to work with an acclaimed director on a high-profile project.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Risky Business'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His next film, Risky Business (1983), grossed $65 million. It also made Cruise a highly recognizable actor — thanks in no small part to a memorable scene of the young star dancing in his underwear.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Top Gun'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1986, after a two-year hiatus, the budding actor released the big-budget fantasy film Legend, which did poorly at the box office. That same year, however, Cruise's A-list status was confirmed with the release of Top Gun, which co-starred Kelly McGillis, Anthony Edwards and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/meg-ryan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Meg Ryan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Meg Ryan</a>. The testosterone-fueled action-romance, set against the backdrop of an elite naval flight school, became the highest-grossing film of 1986.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Color of Money,' 'Rain Man' and 'Born on the Fourth of July'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cruise followed the tremendous success of Top Gun with a string of both critically acclaimed and commercially successful films. He first starred in The Color of Money (1986) with co-star <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/paul-newman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Paul Newman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Paul Newman</a>, and then went on to work with Dustin Hoffman on Rain Man (1988). Cruise's next role, as Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic in the biopic Born on the Fourth of July (1989), earned him an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe for Best Actor.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'A Few Good Men,' 'The Firm' and 'Interview with a Vampire'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1992, Cruise proved once more that he could hold his own opposite a screen legend when he co-starred with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jack-nicholson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jack Nicholson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jack Nicholson</a> in the military courtroom drama A Few Good Men. The film grossed more than $15 million its first weekend and earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination. He continued to demonstrate his success as a leading man with The Firm (1993) and Interview with a Vampire (1994), which co-starred <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/brad-pitt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brad Pitt." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Brad Pitt.</a></p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Mission: Impossible,' 'Jerry McGuire'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Next, Cruise hit the big screen with two huge hits—the $64 million blockbuster Mission: Impossible (1996), which the star also produced, and the highly acclaimed Jerry McGuire (1996), directed by Cameron Crowe. For the latter, Cruise earned a second Academy Award nomination and Golden Globe for Best Actor.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Eyes Wide Shut,' 'Magnolia'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cruise and then-wife Kidman spent much of 1997 and 1998 in England shooting Eyes Wide Shut, an erotic thriller that would be director <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/stanley-kubrick data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stanley Kubrick" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stanley Kubrick</a>'s final film. The movie came out in the summer of 1999 to mixed reviews, but that year Cruise enjoyed greater success with the release of Magnolia. His performance as a self-confident sex guru in the ensemble film earned him another Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Vanilla Sky,' 'The Last Samurai'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cruise then starred in the long-awaited smash hit Mission: Impossible 2 in 2000, alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/anthony-hopkins data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Anthony Hopkins" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Anthony Hopkins</a>, Thandie Newton and Ving Rhames. In 2002, he starred in Vanilla Sky, his second collaboration with Crowe, as well as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/steven-spielberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steven Spielberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Steven Spielberg</a>'s Minority Report. The following year, Cruise traveled to Australia to shoot the $100 million war epic The Last Samurai, which earned him another Golden Globe nomination.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'War of the Worlds'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cruise proved he remained a top draw by starring in the Spielberg-directed remake of the science-fiction classic War of the Worlds (2005), which grossed more than $230 million at the box office.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His next effort, Mission: Impossible 3 (2006), also scored well with audiences. However, Cruise was faced with a professional setback in August when Paramount Pictures ended its 14-year relationship with the actor. The company's chairman cited Cruise's erratic behavior and controversial views as the reason for the split, though industry experts noted that Paramount more likely ended the partnership over Cruise's high earnings from the Mission: Impossible franchise.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cruise quickly rebounded and on November 2, 2006, he announced his new partnership with film executive Paula Wagner and the United Artists film studio. Their first production as a team, the political drama Lions for Lambs (2007), proved a commercial disappointment despite a strong cast that included <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/meryl-streep data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Meryl Streep" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Meryl Streep</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/robert-redford data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Redford" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Redford</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Tropic Thunder'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Taking a break from weighty material, Cruise delighted audiences with his performance in the comedy Tropic Thunder (2008). Despite his relatively small role in a movie that featured <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/robert-downey-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Downey Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Downey Jr.</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ben-stiller data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ben Stiller" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ben Stiller</a>, Cruise stood out by obscuring his trademark good looks to play a balding, obese movie studio executive.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Valkyrie,' 'Rock of Ages'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In December 2008, Cruise released his second project through United Artists. The film, Valkyrie, was a World War II drama about a plot to assassinate German leader <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/adolf-hitler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Adolf Hitler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Adolf Hitler</a>. Cruise starred as a German army officer who became involved in the conspiracy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cruise returned to one of his most popular franchises in 2011 with Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol. Breaking into new territory, he then starred in the 2012 musical Rock of Ages. Although Cruise received some positive reviews for his performance as a rock star, the movie failed to attract much of an audience.</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Jack Reacher,' 'Edge of Tomorrow'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Returning to his mainstream action roots, Cruise starred in the 2012 crime drama Jack Reacher, based on a book by Lee Child. He then headlined a pair of science-fiction adventures, Oblivion (2013) and Edge of Tomorrow (2014). Showing no signs of slowing down, the veteran actor in 2015 delivered his usual high-energy performance for the fifth installment of his blockbuster franchise, Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation.</p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Latest Movies and Familiar Franchises</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2016, Cruise reprised the role of Jack Reacher for Never Go Back. He then headlined a reboot of The Mummy (2017), which performed respectably at the box office but was savaged by critics, before earning better reviews later that year for the crime thriller American Made.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">2018 brought a return to familiar territory for Cruise, who starred in Mission Impossible—Fallout that summer. Prior to its release, he tweeted a photo to mark day 1 of production on the long-awaited sequel Top Gun: Maverick, scheduled for a June 2020 release.</p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Scientology and Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cruise married actress Mimi Rogers in 1987. It was through Rogers that the actor became a student of Scientology, the religion founded by writer L. Ron Hubbard. Cruise credited the church with curing his dyslexia, and he soon became one of its leading proponents. However, while his spiritual life flourished, his marriage to Rogers ended in 1990. That same year, Cruise made the racecar drama Days of Thunder alongside Kidman. Though the movie was unpopular among critics and fans alike, the two lead actors had real chemistry. On Christmas Eve 1990, after a brief courtship, Cruise and Kidman married in Telluride, Colorado.</p><h2 data-node-id=42 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Divorce from Kidman</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For much of the 1990s, Cruise and Kidman found themselves fiercely defending the happiness and legitimacy of their marriage. They filed two different lawsuits against tabloid publications for stories they considered libelous. In each case, the couple received a published retraction and apology, along with a large monetary settlement which they donated to charity. The couple has two children, Isabella and Connor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On February 5, 2001, Cruise and Kidman announced their separation after 11 years of marriage. The couple cited the difficulties involved with two acting careers and the amount of time spent apart while working. Following the divorce, Cruise briefly dated his Vanilla Sky co-star <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/penelope-cruz data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Penelope Cruz" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Penelope Cruz</a>, followed by a much-publicized relationship with actress Katie Holmes. A month after his ties to Holmes became public, Cruise professed his love for the actress in a now-famous appearance on The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/oprah-winfrey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Oprah Winfrey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Oprah Winfrey</a> Show, during which he jumped on Winfrey's sofa, shouting "Yes!"</p><h2 data-node-id=45 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Marriage to Katie Holmes</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In June 2005, after a two-month courtship, Cruise proposed to Holmes in a restaurant at the top of the Eiffel tower. In October, they announced that they were expecting their first child together. The hasty proposal and surprise pregnancy quickly became tabloid gossip. But Cruise made even bigger headlines that year as an outspoken advocate for Scientology. He openly criticized former co-star Brooke Shields for using anti-depressants during her recovery from postpartum depression. He also denounced psychiatry and modern medicine, claiming Scientology held the key to true healing. Cruise's statements led to a heated argument with news anchor Matt Lauer on The Today Show in June 2005, for which Cruise later apologized.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2006, Cruise and Holmes welcomed daughter Suri into the world. That year, they were married in an Italian castle, with celebrities <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/will-smith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Will Smith" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Will Smith</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jada-pinkett-smith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jada Pinkett Smith" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jada Pinkett Smith</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jennifer-lopez data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Lopez" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jennifer Lopez</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/victoria-beckham data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Victoria class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Victoria</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/david-beckham data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="David Beckham" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">David Beckham</a> among those in attendance.
