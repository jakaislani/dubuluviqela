<time>05 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Longtime fans of 'Love & Hip Hop' have grown to love and adore the beautiful relationship between 'Love & Hip Hop: New York' star Yandy Smith and her beau Mendeecees Harris. Yandy's fierce loyalty and love for Mendeecees while he was in the prison and her passion for prison reform stemming from his experience left many impressed. The couple even had a televised wedding right before he was sent to prison on drug-related charges. Although Yandy later admitted that their wedding wasn't legally recognized and was just for the television, the couple's 14-year strong bond continues to awe everybody around them. In case you're curious to know more about the couple's relationship, then read on.</p><p><strong>How did Yandy Smith and Mendeecees Harris meet?</strong></p><p>Yandy recounted the moment she first met Mendeecees on one of TV One's 'Uncensored' series episodes. The reality star revealed that she was managing rapper Jim Jones, and attended one of his concerts at Miami in 2006, which is when she crossed paths with the love of her life. Yandy recounted thinking that Mendeecees was 'gorgeous' when she first saw him. She said, "So I’m handing out the room keys when we got to Miami, I met everyone there. And I’m like ok, ‘Mendeecees Harris.’ And I remember immediately thinking, ‘This boy is gorgeous.’ But you know, I’m working. And as far as I know, at the time, this is one of Jim’s friends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/019904fb-91df-4bf5-8207-99234ec44257.1157862702><p>Later that night Jim Jones hosted a party, while everybody was excited about the party, Yandy instead opted to not attend the party and stay back at the hotel. Mendeecees too surprised her by deciding to stay back and spend the time getting to know her instead of enjoying a wild party. "So I’m making sure everybody gets into the van. And they’re all dressed up. I come down in my sweats. And Mendeecees is like, ‘You coming to the party like that or you not going.’ I was like, ‘Oh, I’m not going.’ He was like, ‘You not going? I’m probably not going to go either,'" shared the reality star.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was like, ‘Okay.’ I pile everybody in the van and I go to the bar. He came to the bar and he was like, ‘Why didn’t you go?’ And I said, ‘Oh, I never party with my client. I’m good.’ Then he said, ‘Why don’t I buy you a drink?’ And I’m like, ‘Okay," added Yandy. The couple reportedly ended up talking for hours. Mendeecees reportedly knew that night itself that Yandy was the one, and decided to pursue her.&nbsp;</p><p>After their impromptu first date, Yandy was all set to leave Miami, the next day. Mendeecees seems to have taken a leaf from the several rom-com movies, for him to have not only cut short his Miami stay, but he also followed the reality star back to New York. Yandy joked about how he paid her co-passenger $200 to sit next to her. This move definitely caught the 'LHH' star's attention, as the couple soon began dating. Eight years later in 2014, Mendeecees proposed to her and had a televised wedding in 2015. The couple have two children together.</p><p><strong>What is the net worth of Mendeecees Harris and Yandy Smith?</strong></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Yandy's net worth is estimated to be at a whopping $15 million.
