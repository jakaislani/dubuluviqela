If you’re looking for some TV to get you into the spirit of the fall season, then we’ve got you covered.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>We’ve broken down fourteen of the best episodes and shows (seven of each) to watch as you’re getting ready for sweater weather. These are the shows that will make you feel like fall has finally arrived, whether you want something comforting or a little more unnerving to beckon you further into spooky season.</p><h2 id=h-only-murders-in-the-building data-injectable=false>Only Murders in the Building</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false>Wrapped in fall vibes, with a New York twist, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Only Murders in the Building</a> follows three aspiring podcasters who live in a New York apartment building and decide to investigate the death of a fellow tenant.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>The series is a comedy with true crime trappings, but it’s also filled to the brim with great coats and sweaters. You’re not likely to find a cozier, more endearing show to put on on a brisk but refreshing fall evening.</p><h2 id=h-friends-season-3-episode-9-the-one-with-the-football data-injectable=false>Friends season 3, episode 9: “The One With the Football”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Friends</a> was famous for its football episodes, and “The One With the Football” may be the cream of the crop. The episode’s centerpiece is a football game that renews an old sibling rivalry between Monica and Ross, and leaves the rest of the central friends completely baffled.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>The episode is hilarious, at least if you can get past the obviously strange childhood that Ross and Monica shared with one another. It’s really all about the jokes, though, and “The One With the Football” has plenty.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Gilmore Girls</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>There are plenty of episodes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gilmore Girls</a> centered around holidays like Thanksgiving, but ultimately, the entire series has pretty incredible fall vibes.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>The clothes always seem to be built around the fall season, and the small town of Stars Hollow is the kind of place many of us might like to visit in the quiet of fall. The banter at the heart of Gilmore Girls is always great, regardless of the</p><h2 data-injectable=false>New Girl season 2, episode 8: “Parents”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>Thanksgiving is a seminal fall holiday, so it’s no surprise that many of the best fall TV episodes are centered on that day. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New Girl</a>, which is set in Los Angeles, we don’t get a ton of fall foliage, but we do get a classic family-oriented sitcom setup.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>When both of Jess’s parents show up for dinner, she decides to try and pull a Parent Trap on them. Fortunately, this is New Girl, so nothing goes according to plan, and plenty of heartwarming hilarity ensues.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Haunting of Hill House</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Mike Flanagan has proven to be an expert at terrifying Netflix series that all have some sort of fall vibe, but The Haunting of Hill House may still be his best. The limited series tells the story of a family who experienced a tragedy some 20 years prior, and is still living with the fallout of that night.</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Thanks to plenty of great performances and a smart central structure, Hill House is plenty scary, even as it delves into the personal lives of each member of this family.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Stranger Things season 2, episode 2: “Trick or Treat, Freak”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stranger Things</a> always has vaguely spooky vibes, but that was especially true of “Trick or Treat, Freak”, the season 2 episode centered on Halloween ups the tension around the central mystery, even as it gives us a chance to see the central quartet of boys get their Ghostbusters on.</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>Season 2 of Stranger Things tends to get a bad rap, but there’s plenty to love in the second season, including this outing, which is shockingly the only episode the show has ever done set around Halloween.</p><h2 id=h-this-is-us data-injectable=false>This Is Us</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>Another show that technically takes place at a wide variety of different points in the year, This Is Us is above all else an extended ode to the vibe of Thanksgiving. The Pierson family is constantly expressing gratitude to one another, and paying tribute to the legacy that their parents have left for them.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>One of the most brilliant things about the show is the way that family is so intrinsic to it, and that, in addition to its numerous Thanksgiving episodes, makes it a great inclusion on this list.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Gossip Girl season 3, episode 11: “The Treasure of Serena Madre”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>As a show that was pretty consistently replete with drama, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gossip Girl</a> is actually an ideal vehicle for an explosive Thanksgiving dinner gone awry. In “The Treasure of the Serena Madre”, it’s drama all the way down the line as Blair begins to suspect that her mother is hiding a major secret and Serena is made exceedingly uncomfortable by some unexpected dinner guests.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=154 data-injectable=false>The outfits are on point, but this episode is a good reminder that getting together with family isn’t always the rewarding experience it should be.</p><h2 id=h-chilling-adventures-of-sabrina data-injectable=false>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</a> is the perfect show to gear up for the spooky season and enjoy all throughout. It is a retelling of Sabrina the Teenage Witch and is a dark and horrific show filled with twists. and turns.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>Sabrina is a half-human, half-witch who is forced to navigate being both a mortal teenager and maintaining her family’s legacy. While the show is scary at its core, it is also a coming-of-age story with a number of relatable moments.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Twin Peaks season 1, episode 1: “Pilot”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twin Peaks</a> actually takes place in the winter, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have impeccable fall vibes. Set in a small town in Washington that’s filled with coffee and pie, Twin Peaks is a murder mystery that delves into the evil at the heart of American small-town life.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>The pilot follows the aftermath of the discovery that Laura Palmer, the town’s sweetheart has been murdered. It’s not exactly a fun watch, but it is thrilling and off-beat, and it may be just what you need to settle into the fall.</p><h2 id=h-friday-night-lights data-injectable=false>Friday Night Lights</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>A show about football, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Friday Night Lights</a> is probably the best way to feel like you’re watching football in between games. This show, which follows a football team in a depressed Texas town, is all about what it can mean for the team, and the town, when the football team is good.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>The show has a sprawling ensemble cast, but it’s also deeply heartfelt. Few shows on TV were more sincere than Friday Night Lights, which could make you weep even as you were thrilled by improbably comeback victory after improbable comeback victory.</p><h2 id=h-modern-family-season-2-episode-6-halloween data-injectable=false>Modern Family season 2, episode 6: “Halloween”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>One of the best parts about fall is, of course, Halloween. And, no one does it better than the Dunphy’s and Pritchett’s. This Halloween-themed episode is not only a fun fall treat, but it’s also one of the most humorous of the series.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=179 data-injectable=false>It has all the best parts of a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Family</a> episode, with Claire being ultra-competitive, Cam has a complicated history with the holiday, and Jay and Manny poking fun at Gloria.</p><h2 id=h-parks-and-recreation-season-3-episode-7-harvest-festival data-injectable=false>Parks and Recreation season 3, episode 7: “Harvest Festival”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>Another fantastic, albeit questionably-aged fall episode to add to your watchlist is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parks and Recreation</a>‘s “Harvest Festival”. The episode shows Leslie as she finds herself in trouble with a Wamapoke tribal leader who threatens to put a curse on the upcoming Harvest Festival.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>The festival took seven episodes to come to fruition, creating lots of anticipation for viewers. And, it doesn’t disappoint in terms of giving all of the fall vibes.</p><h2 id=h-charmed data-injectable=false>Charmed</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>One more spooky show to round out the list! <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charmed</a> is perfect for getting you in the Halloween spirit, as it follows three sisters who also happen to be the most powerful witches in the entire world.</p><p data-characters=93 data-current-count=93 data-injectable=false>The show is filled with supernatural storylines and has a warm setting that feels like fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yjsdKtZJ%2BZnKF6przIrKadnaNiwKm71qxknKeqrnq0w8Saq56qXayyosDHnqlo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-fall-episodes-shows-cozy-sweater-weather.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-fall-episodes-shows-cozy-sweater-weather.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-fall-episodes-shows-cozy-sweater-weather.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-fall-episodes-shows-cozy-sweater-weather.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-fall-episodes-shows-cozy-sweater-weather.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-fall-episodes-shows-cozy-sweater-weather.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-virgin-suicides-2000.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-virgin-suicides-2000.html>The Virgin Suicides movie review (2000)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./evan-mcpherson-brother-family.html>Evan McPherson Brother: Who Are Logan And Alex McPherson?
