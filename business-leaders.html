She was also known for her philanthropic endeavors, including a donation toward the construction of an Indianapolis YMCA in 1913. Walker's life was portrayed in the 2020 TV show Self Made, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/octavia-spencer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Octavia Spencer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Octavia Spencer</a> portraying Walker.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Walker was born Sarah Breedlove on December 23, 1867, on a cotton plantation near Delta, Louisiana. Her parents, Owen and Minerva, were enslaved and recently freed, and Sarah, who was their fifth child, was the first in her family to be free-born.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Minerva died in 1874 and Owen passed away the following year, both due to unknown causes, leaving Sarah an orphan at the age of seven. After her parents' passing, Sarah was sent to live with her sister, Louvinia, and her brother-in-law.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The three moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1877, where Sarah picked cotton and was likely employed doing household work, although no documentation exists verifying her employment at the time.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Daughter A'Lelia Walker" data-anchor-id=daughter-alelia-walker class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Daughter A'Lelia Walker</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At age 14, to escape both her oppressive working environment and the frequent mistreatment she endured at the hands of her brother-in-law, Sarah married a man named Moses McWilliams. On June 6, 1885, Sarah gave birth to a daughter, A'Lelia.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Moses died two years later, Sarah and A'Lelia moved to St. Louis, where Sarah's brothers had established themselves as barbers. There, Sarah found work as a washerwoman, earning $1.50 a day — enough to send her daughter to the city's public schools.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She also attended public night school whenever she could. While in St. Louis, Breedlove met husband Charles J. Walker, who worked in advertising and would later help promote her hair care business.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 title="Hair Care" data-anchor-id=hair-care class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Hair Care</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the 1890s, Sarah developed a scalp disorder that caused her to lose much of her hair, and she began to experiment with both home remedies and store-bought hair care treatments in an attempt to improve her condition.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1905, she was hired as a commission agent by Annie Turnbo Malone — a successful, Black, hair-care product entrepreneur — and she moved to Denver, Colorado.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 title="Madam C.J.

Her husband also encouraged her to use the more recognizable name "Madam C.J. Walker," by which she was thereafter known.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1907 Walker and her husband traveled around the South and Southeast promoting her products and giving lecture demonstrations of her "Walker Method" — involving her own formula for pomade, brushing and the use of heated combs.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 title="Walker Agents" data-anchor-id=walker-agents class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Walker Agents</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As profits continued to grow, in 1908 Walker opened a factory and a beauty school in Pittsburgh, and by 1910, when Walker transferred her business operations to Indianapolis, the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company had become wildly successful, with profits that were the modern-day equivalent of several million dollars.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In Indianapolis, the company not only manufactured cosmetics but also trained sales beauticians. These "Walker Agents" became well known throughout the Black communities of the United States. In turn, they promoted Walker's philosophy of "cleanliness and loveliness" as a means of advancing the status of African Americans.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A relentless innovator, Walker organized clubs and conventions for her representatives, which recognized not only successful sales, but also philanthropic and educational efforts among African Americans.</p><img alt="Madam C.J.

While her mother traveled, A'Lelia helped facilitate the purchase of property in Harlem, New York, recognizing that the area would be an important base for future business operations.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1916, upon returning from her travels, Walker moved to her new townhouse in Harlem. From there, she would continue to operate her business, while leaving the day-to-day operations of her factory in Indianapolis to its forelady.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Walker quickly immersed herself in the social and political culture of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/roaring-twenties/harlem-renaissance data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harlem Renaissance" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Harlem Renaissance</a>.
