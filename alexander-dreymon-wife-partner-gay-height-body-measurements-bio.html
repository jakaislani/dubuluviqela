<time>17 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Had he granted his parents’ wish, Alexander Dreymon would have been in the medical field, but he found another path to follow in life and it apparently paid off.&nbsp;He is most popular for his portrayal of Uhtred of Bebbanburg in&nbsp;</span><span>The Last Kingdom</span><span>&nbsp;shown on BBC Two.</span></p><p>He is a German-born actor who has graced many theatrical productions in Europe, such as&nbsp;<span>Mustard</span><span>&nbsp;at the Soho Theater in London and&nbsp;</span><span>Angels&nbsp;</span><span>in America</span><span>&nbsp;at the Théâtre du Marais in Paris.&nbsp;One of his most talked about roles can be seen in the British film&nbsp;</span><span>Christopher and His</span><span>&nbsp;Kind where he played a gay character alongside MattForgeron.&nbsp;Due to the nature of some of the characters he portrayed, different speculations arose regarding his sexuality which will be explained in this article.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Bio of Alexander Dreymon</span></strong></h2><p><span>The handsome actor was given the name AlexandreDötsch when he was born in Germany on February 7, 1983. Due to his mother’s frequent moves, Alexander grew up in many places including the United States, Germany and Germany. Swiss.&nbsp;While in the United States, he resided in San Francisco and South Dakota.&nbsp;He also spent time in France after his mother had to move house to care for his aunt who had a riding accident.</span></p><p><span>Alexander Dreymon’s father is not constant in his life, but the relationship between the two is not strained.</span></p><p><span>Dreymon was educated in Paris and although his parents aspired to a career in medicine, he grew up knowing he would want to become an actor.&nbsp;Thus, he honed his skills at the Drama Center London for three years.&nbsp;In addition, he was trained in martial arts, and during his stay in South Dakota, Dreymon made the most of this opportunity to learn how to ride a horse.&nbsp;Perhaps as a result of his trip to different countries, Alexander Dreymond is fluent in English, French and German.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Career timeline</span></strong></h2><p><span>The hunky actor has warmed the hearts of many with his good looks and talent which he uses to knock out any role he plays.&nbsp;After a few stage appearances in London and Paris, Dreymon made his screen debut in the French drama Ni Reprise Ni Exchangee.&nbsp;His career gradually progressed and gained a lot of attention after his stint in the British film&nbsp;</span><span>Christopher and the Like</span><span>&nbsp;(2011) where he played the lead role of Caspar,&nbsp;</span><span>Doctor Who</span><span>&nbsp;in love Matt Smith.</span></p><p><span>He then acted in many short films while exploring the entertainment industry in the United States.&nbsp;Subsequently, he appeared in five episodes of&nbsp;</span><span>American Horror Story</span><span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;</span><span>Coven</span><span>&nbsp;– Season Three, as Luke Ramsey.</span></p><p><span>His latest offering is in the BBC Two show&nbsp;</span><span>The Last Kingdom</span><span>&nbsp;where he brings the character of Uhtred of Bebbanburg to life.&nbsp;The show debuted on October 10, 2015 and garnered an impressive fan base.</span></p><p>He also starred in several other films like&nbsp;<span>Who’s Watching Who</span><span>&nbsp;(2011),&nbsp;</span><span>The Resistance</span><span>&nbsp;(2011),&nbsp;</span><span>Blood Ransom</span><span>&nbsp;(2014),&nbsp;</span><span>The Test of Time</span><span>&nbsp;(2015) and&nbsp;</span><span>Guys Reading Poems</span><span>&nbsp;(2016).</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Alexander Dreymon gay?&nbsp;wife/partner</span></strong></h2><p><span>Due to the fact that the hunky actor has portrayed a few gay characters remarkably well, a lot of rumors about his sexual orientation have been doing the rounds.&nbsp;Following his role in&nbsp;</span><span>Christopher and the Like</span><span>, many thought he must be gay but nonetheless, there is no concrete confirmation to these claims as he did not come out as gay.&nbsp;Besides, he has also played many roles as a straight and is said to have had a romantic relationship with Greek actress Tonia Sotiropoulou.</span></p><p><span>Again, his 2015 comment on his gender – “Most of my friends are actually French because I grew up for quite a while in France” proves he’s not gay. .&nbsp;However, he is presumed to be single and has never been married to anyone before.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height and body measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>One look at Alexander Dreymon is enough to confirm his good looks that have kept his fanbase on the upswing since he took the screen by storm.&nbsp;The German actor sports a height of 1.78m but verified information about his weight is not available online.&nbsp;Likewise, details regarding his body measurements aren’t available, but it’s no secret that he’s well-endowed in all the right places.</span></p><p class=postsid
